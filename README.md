# VMware-Virtual-initiative (Under Construction)

The VMware Virtual Initiative Project teaches students about virtualization through hands-on experience in creating and managing a virtual environment. My goal is to help students experiment with IT technologies and explore various IT topics through guided sessions to foster peer-to-peer learning.

> Disclaimer !!!
The project is based off VMware Workstation on a windows environment.<br>
Issues/Configurations on Linux, MacOS, VMware Fusion, Hyper-V, and VirtualBox have not be tested. (Planned for the Future)
